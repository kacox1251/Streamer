# Streamer

## Description 
Streamer is an application that allows users to create an account, 
and keep track of movies and TV shows that they want to watch.

As a team we felt motivated to create this application because the world has so many different shows and movies. 
Some of which you can only find on one of the many specific platforms available today. Streamer aims to help users filter and organize
all of the many options so that no one loses track of a favorite show.

Streamer uses authentication based log-ins to grab and store data into our database. 
Each user has their own data, where they can keep track of the shows/movies they wish to watch, 
what shows/movies they have already started, and which shows they have completed.
Each user can find a title by either searching for it specifically, or they can browse the top 20
mos popular on the home page. Their profile shows all of the titles the user has stored, as well as a chart to give a good visual
of current viewing habits.

This project has been a fun and challenging experience. It showcases just how far we have all come
in learning these new technologies, and our journey as developers.
